The United States Department of Agriculture provides data sets ranging from food
supply, economic demand, and remote sensing through the Agriculture Statistical Service (NASS)
and Economic Research Service (ERS). This application provides an analytics dashboard
and data exploration to help bring to light answers to important questions such as determining
crop yield over time, the relationship to climate change, to simpler questions such as where
food actually comes from.
