# USDA

The United States Department of Agriculture provides data sets ranging from food
supply, economic demand, and remote sensing through the Agriculture Statistical Service (NASS)
and Economic Research Service (ERS). This application provides an analytics dashboard
and data exploration to help bring to light answers to important questions such as determining
crop yield over time, the relationship to climate change, to simpler questions such as where
food actually comes from.

## Examples

The following are categories of examples pertaining to how we might create a useful dashboard for our users. We want to draw as much as possible from reports generated by the USDA itself. Some common examples in relation to economics, food production and utilization are expanded upon below.

### Citrus Fruit

An example report is provided by the USDA on Citrus Fruit. (http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CitrFrui/CitrFrui-09-18-2014.pdf). This report specifies details in relationship to the following:

* Utilized Citrus Production (over 2004-2014)
* Citrus Value of Production (over 2004-2014)
* Citrus Acreage and Bearing
* Citrus Type Yield
* Citrus Type Price

Typically these are broken down by the citrus fruit type such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons..etc. Each item details the bearing acreage, production (total, fresh, processed), value of production, yield per acre, utilization, price per box (all, fresh, processed). Simple graphs detailing individual food types will show some fairly significant trends such as the total bearing acreage over time in steady decline. By visualizing these items we may be able to show a very simple extrapolation to show if and when the particular food items are at risk for depletion.
