# USDA

The United States Department of Agriculture provides data sets ranging from food
supply, economic demand, and remote sensing through the Agriculture Statistical Service (NASS)
and Economic Research Service (ERS). This application provides an analytics dashboard
and data exploration to help bring to light answers to important questions such as determining
crop yield over time, the relationship to climate change, to simpler questions such as where
food actually comes from.

## Features / Proposals

* Crop/Fruit/Vegetable/Food dashboard visualizing production, yield, acreage, value, price over time
  * Examples include: Oranges Dashboard
  * Data is available for all of the attributes listed at state and possibly county level
  * Should demonstrate assessment for risk
* Integrate with national weather service or another api
  * Determine if we can store major weather events
    * droughts, extreme rainfall, frost
  * Api for looking up temperature and rainfall over time
  * Some maps on weather.com show frost and drought severity indicators
    * possibly utilize this over time to visualize conditions
* Visualize weather seasonal weather conditions as events
  * Users can make conclusions as to how this affects conditions
  * Ex: no rainfall for significant portion of year
     * Ex vegetable: asparagus weather conditions by state

## Examples

The following are categories of examples pertaining to how we might create a useful dashboard for our users. We want to draw as much as possible from reports generated by the USDA itself. Some common examples in relation to economics, food production and utilization are expanded upon below.

### Citrus Fruit

An example report is provided by the USDA on Citrus Fruit. (http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CitrFrui/CitrFrui-09-18-2014.pdf). This report specifies details in relationship to the following:

* Utilized Citrus Production (over 2004-2014)
* Citrus Value of Production (over 2004-2014)
* Citrus Acreage and Bearing
* Citrus Type Yield
* Citrus Type Price

Typically these are broken down by the citrus fruit type such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons..etc. Each item details the bearing acreage, production (total, fresh, processed), value of production, yield per acre, utilization, price per box (all, fresh, processed). Simple graphs detailing individual food types will show some fairly significant trends such as the total bearing acreage over time in steady decline. By visualizing these items we may be able to show a very simple extrapolation to show if and when the particular food items are at risk for depletion.

In addition, production and utilization is noted according to the state and possibly county level. By leveraging this particular data set, we can visualize the percentage of production and utilization over time with reference to a given state. If for instance, 100% of a particular fruit happens to be produced by a single state or area and over time that area is in decline - conclusions can be drawn by the user as to the reasons why that is. For instance, if year after year yield is becoming less and less, while utilization remains steadily the same - we can conclude that our consumption is not the reason it is running out and perhaps climate may be a factor, or pests or other concerns.

### Vegetables

Vegetable production reports demonstrate similar attributes to yield, production, utilization, value and acreage as citrus fruit categories. A sample report (http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/Vege/Vege-09-04-2014.pdf) shows various food items and their reports over time. Additional comments are made with respect to individual food items about food production in relationship to climate conditions. For example, the report notes a decade long decline for asparagus acreage. We should be able to easily determine these trends without much effort using a standard linear regression model over expected acreage, yield and utilization. Since these items are perishable, stockpile is somewhat irrelevant and thus a contining decline in yield demonstrates risk for depletion. 

Additional notes are made in the report with respect to weather conditions. Specifically, drought conditions and lack of rainfall during various seasons has a significant impact on crop production. We should be able to utilize the national weather service to show conditions for rainfall over time and determine whether a decline in production is related (otherwise, our visualizations should be able to note and simply graph rain conditions over time for a specific state as a sidenote.) In fact, many of the comments on the sample report note weather conditions affecting crop production (such as frosting during certain months, heavy rains during an off season..etc.
